# Tubsted Color Theme

Slightly modified version of [Tubster Color Theme](https://github.com/AaronHolbrook/Tubster-Color-Scheme) for my taste.

## Install

To install through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control),
search for **Tubsted Color Scheme**. If you still don't have Package Control in Sublime Text, [go get it](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation).
It's pure awesomeness.

If you insist to not install it, you can download the package and
put it manually inside your `Pacakages` directory. It should work but will not update automatically.

## Usage

Add the following line to your Sublime Text preferences file: `"color_scheme": "Packages/sublime-tubsted-color-scheme/Tubsted.tmTheme"`.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
